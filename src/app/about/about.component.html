  <h1>About Us</h1>


  PDXbnb is an application that will be used as a data visualization tool.


  A big thanks to Tom Slee for scrapping this data from Airbnb and providing it for common use. Airbnb is notoriously tight lipped when it comes to releasing its own data and we believe the people of Portland and those who want to visit should have access to it. You can find all the data, for Portland and multiple cities, here.
